# What is SquatConf?

Some of us are lucky enough to attend marvelous conventions, made with love by amazing people. Great events with top-notch speakers, incredible venues, and amazing parties.

These conferences are run with huge contributions from volunteers, and financial support from sponsors, providing top-notch events at affordable prices.

But even then, they're not affordable for everyone.

these are the intentions behind first squatconf, why would we want to pay expensive venue when we can organise this in a squat, creating a beneficial synergy in the process

This is almost what happened , but it did not ended as a more than a 'tech' conference ...  

This is why squatconf will be on donation, because we belive that no one should ask for diversity tickets, and that Information wants to be free.

SquatConf won't be your everyday conference, but we'll have good talks from amazing people. It'll be donation-based, and you'll get to contribute if you want to.

## How is this possible?

Conference costs are huge, and ticket prices are often [nowhere near the true per-attendee cost](http://2014.lxjs.org/about/), even for a non-profit conference.

Fancy venues, transportation, hotels and food are really nice perks to have, but…

If you hold a conference in a squat…
the speakers advance their travel expenses…


If you work with the available infrastructure and local community as much as possible, with a little help of everyone you'll have a zero-cost conference made with love, but a little rougher around the edges.

## The Plan

We are a bunch of crazy programmers that believe in decentralised systems, conferences included.

We will provide a space, we will provide a context, some talks, and the rest will be up to you…

## Who is behind this

a bunch of ppl that had fun at the first one, or knew each others before, coming from loads of different horizons.

## I want to give a talk!

Please see [our talks repository](https://github.com/squatconf/talks) to propose a talk.
